djregs
======

djregs is a Django app designed to make your life easy when signing up new
users. This library provides:

* Models to handle the registration
* Views/forms to manage the sign-up process
* Email address activation

djregs supports Django 1.5 and 1.6. Upon the release of 1.7, we will follow
Django's policy for supported versions.

I also intend to add more views, forms, models and other classes to provide
the building blocks for constructing your own sign-up and activation
processes.


Relationship to django-registration
===================================

This is a full fork of the django-registration app originally built by James
Bennett.
